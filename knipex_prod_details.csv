      Multifunctional pliers for the electrical installation; to grip flat and round material, for bending, deburring, cutting cable, stripping and crimping wire ferrules
  

                

      In case of models with opening spring integrated in the joint, the activated locking lever keeps the cutting edges closed while other functions remain active
      The intelligent latching mechanism enables you to ""grip"" without opening the pliers. The cutting edge remains closed and protected.
      Smooth surfaces near the tips grip single cores without damaging them; serrated gripping surfaces and pipe grip for gripping flat and round material
      Clear-cut outside edge on the gripping surfaces for working on flush-mounted junction boxes and deburring feed-through holes
      Stripping holes for conductors of 0.75 - 1.5 mm² and 2.5 mm²
      Crimping die for wire ferrules 0.5 - 2.5 mm²
      Cable shears with (induction-hardened) precision cutting edges for copper and aluminium cables up to 5 x 2.5 mm² / Ø 15 mm
